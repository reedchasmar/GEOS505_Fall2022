My research consists of 1) quantifying the spatiotemporal variability of E. coli in two Treasure Valley canal systems, and 2) estimating the metabolic rates of gross primary production (GPP) and ecosystem respiration (ER) within one of the canals throughout the 2022 growing season.

I will use scientific computing in my research to 1) perform spatial dependence analyses between E. coli levels at variably-spaced sampling sites, and 2) develop several stream metabolism models (i.e., MLE and Bayes) that predict dissolved oxygen trends based on external inputs of temperature, light availability and water depth. I intend to use the Matplotlib library for Python to represent my results in a concise, visually-appealing and professional way.

1. Goal 1: Learn how to fluidly interact with GitHub through the Bash Terminal so that I can share my code with my advisor (2 Weeks)
2. Goal 2: Learn the basics for using Python and Jupyter Notebook (3 Weeks)
3. Goal 3: Learn how to problem solve online when I get stuck in the GitBash terminal (Now)
4. Goal 4: Learn what the best figure options are in Matplotlib library to visualize my results in an compelling way
5. Goal 5: Learn how to separate my Jupyter notebooks into separate environments based on common library dependencies and related workflows
